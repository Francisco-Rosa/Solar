### Preparation

* If you want to use the rendered frames, you must install the Render Workbench, prepare rendering projects and test them preventively to make sure everything is working correctly (see information in [FreeCAD-Render](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-render)). It is also recommended to take advantage and use some cameras from this workbench that better show the animation.
* If you want to use the play and record rendered animation frames, you must install the Movie Workbench [FreeCAD-Movie](https://github.com/Francisco-Rosa/FreeCAD-Movie/tree/master).
