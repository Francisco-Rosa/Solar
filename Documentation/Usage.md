<br/>

## Sky Domes Dialog

Here you can configure your sky domes.

<img width = '600' src = '../Resources/Media/Dialogs/SkyDome.webp' />

To create a SkyDomes, click "Create SkyDomes" button and configure them in the dialog window. To modify a SkyDomes, click "Modify SkyDomes" button with the respective SkyDomes already selected. To delete SkyDomes, select them and click "Delete SkyDomes" button.

IMPORTANT: 

* Once Skydomes are created, do not modify their structure of the groups in the FreeCAD object tree, as this will prevent future modifications.

* This is the first implementation of solar domes using the ladybug libraries; therefore, the results obtained may still contain errors or deviations.

* If this occurs, please report it in the forum link indicated below.
